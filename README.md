# codecaddy-landing
So, i have designed a landing page for a website called as "CodeCandy — Your snippets, supercharged." It basically can save, search and send our code snippets anywhere. 
I have added all the required conditions like a navbar, hero, integrations, features, faqs, contact us and a footer. 
I have generated the code with chatgpt and images from gemini and video from pixverse.
The webpage is dynamic in nature with a video playing in background.
The backend is supported by google firebase and it is fully working and we can receive name, email, organization of user and their message.
